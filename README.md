# Blog-Project---Web-Development-Course-Udacity

This is a basic blog with functionalities to add blog entries and access their JSON data. 

I'm using webapp2 for building the blog and Google Datastore as the database. 

I've also integrated an IP lookup service to serve up static Google maps to indicate the user's location.

Currently, I've also made a login service but it's not properly integrated into the app. Will do that later.
