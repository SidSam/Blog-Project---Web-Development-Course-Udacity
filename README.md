# Blog-Project---Web-Development-Course-Udacity

This is a basic blog with functionalities to add blog entries and access their JSON data. I'm using webapp2 for building the blog and Google Datastore as the database. Currently, I do have a function to put up a map of the entry but I've not integrated it into the actual website. Will do that later.
