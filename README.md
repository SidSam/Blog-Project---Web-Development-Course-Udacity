# Blog-Project---Web-Development-Course-Udacity

This is a basic blog with functionalities to add blog entries and access their JSON data. 

I'm using webapp2 for building the blog and Google Datastore as the database. 

I've also integrated an IP lookup service to serve up static Google maps to indicate the user's location.

There's also a login functionality that logs in users with hashed cookie values.

While registering new users, there's a simple regex mechanism for validating the username and password.

One can also view the JSON contents of the main page, and the bottom of almost every page, there's a small timer which keeps track of how long ago the last query to that page was made. 

I haven't added much styling. This app was just a sandbox for me to learn.
